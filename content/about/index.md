Hi, im havertz21 ( u can find me as havertz2110, anhhavertz) :)

I'm currently:
- Studying Information Security (Honor Program) at University of Information Technology VNU HCM city ~~
- Doing random in [UIT InsecLab](https://inseclab.uit.edu.vn/) <3

My currently working area is AI (mostly on GNN and LLM). Moreover, I also play ctf but not as frequently as before, im still eager to learn and wait for the right time :) I play misc, a bit reverse and study lightly on web.

p/s: This blog is inspired by a brother in UIT: Jinn (lephuduc)
