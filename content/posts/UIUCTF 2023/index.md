Hello, this is some lines for this UIUCTF 2023 contest. First, Im very happy because this is the first time I stepped into top 50 of an international contest with my team `phis1Ng__`, therefore, I think I need to write something in order to keep this as a memory and to save some new ideas and techniques used this time.

Im responsible for 2 areas in my team: Misc and Osint(Rev is done only after the contest), and that's all, here we go :D
