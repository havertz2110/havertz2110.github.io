Hello, this is me and my bro's writeup for DEFCON 31 AI VILLAGE. We finished at top 25%, which is pretty acceptable for a first try. Even at first we managed to solve nearly half of the problems easily and got to top 10%, but then we found it so confused for us and we made so little progress in the end. 
After all, we did manage to solve 13/27 in the contest, then after a while of infinite tries, I managed to solve a couple more, made the final sum to 24/27 hehehehehe (but sadly, still, doesnt count anyway) GGWP.
